/**
 *
 Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.

 '?' Matches any single character.
 '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
 The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

 Note:

 s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
 p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like ? or *.

  For each element in s
    If *s==*p or *p == ? which means this is a match, then goes to next element s++ p++.
    If p=='*', this is also a match, but one or many chars may be available, so let us save this *'s position and the matched s position.
    If not match, then we check if there is a * previously showed up,
       if there is no *,  return false;
       if there is an *,  we set current p to the next element of *, and set current s to the next saved s position.
